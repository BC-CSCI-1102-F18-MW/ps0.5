# Problem Set 1

## Due September 5th at 11:59pm local time

### Part 1: Access the Problem Set

1. Create a folder on your computer for this class called CS2 or CS1102. I have mine on my Desktop so I don't have to drill down to far to find it.

2. By now you should have received an email with an invitation to accept Problem Set 1. If you didn't receive the email or can't find it because you deleted it, like I probably would have, you can find the link on Canvas. Accept the invitation, and then download the associated repository as a zip file, move the zip to the folder you created in Step 1, and unzip it.

3. You now have the git repository ("repo") you need to complete the programming portion of the problem set, which will be described in part 3. 

### Part 2: Install Java SE

1. Although there are several newer versions of Java, we'll be using Java 8. Download the Java SE Development Kit 8u181 (the last three numbers might be different, that's okay!) for your operating system from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

2. After you download the dmg (Mac) or exe (Windows), double-click it to start the installation. Click where you need to click to complete the installation, and you should be all set. If something goes wrong, contact a TA. 

### Part 3: Install the textbook libraries `algs4.jar`

1. Installing `algs4.jar`

One of the nice things about the Algorithms book is the extensive software library developed by the authors. The library is housed in the Java archive `algs4.jar`.  The simplest option for setting this up is to use the automated installation scripts developed by SW. **NB: follow ONLY step 0 of the instructions there**.

+ [MacOS](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/mac/)
+ [Windows](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/windows/)

Following the instructions **only for Step 0** and executing the downloaded installer script on your computer will download the `algs4.jar` library for you (along with other tools).

2. Setting the `CLASSPATH` variable

Java needs to know where to look for libraries that are not included with the Java installation. You use the CLASSPATH variable to tell Java where you have installed add-on libraries like `algs4`.
